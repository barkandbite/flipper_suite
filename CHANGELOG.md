## 2026-07-19 — sample cards & CI trigger

### feat
- **ccid_emulator_sample_cards**: Added five real-world `.ccid` card profiles for on-device reader testing, each validated to parse within the post-#59 bounds against the actual `card_parser.c`: `emv_visa_contactless.ccid` (PPSE / 2PAY.SYS.DDF01 + Visa AID + GPO — its PPSE response is 110 bytes, which the old 32-byte cap would have truncated), `emv_mastercard_contact.ccid` (PSE / 1PAY.SYS.DDF01 + Mastercard AID), `openpgp_card.ccid` (`gpg --card-status` flow), `yubikey_oath.ccid` (YKOATH SELECT/LIST), and `iso7816_memory.ccid` (generic ISO 7816-4 SELECT/READ BINARY/VERIFY). Real published AIDs with illustrative test data — not dumps of real cards. Added a `README.md` documenting the format, each card, and how to drive them from a PC (`pcsc_scan`, `opensc-tool`, `gpg`).

### chore
- **CI**: Changed `.github/workflows/build.yml` to `workflow_dispatch` (manual-only) so the build/lint matrix no longer fires on every bot-pushed branch; run it from the Actions tab or via the API. Verified the whole 13-FAP suite builds and lints cleanly against the OFW SDK before this change.
- **examples audit**: Confirmed the other file-driven apps already ship runnable examples (badusb_pro `.ds` scripts, evil_portal portals + `.fpwn` scripts, flipperpwn modules; hid_exfil payloads are built in by design), so no additional example files were needed there.

## 2026-07-19

### fix
- **ccid_emulator**: Fixed APDU command/response rules being silently truncated at 32 bytes (issue #59). `CCID_EMU_MAX_APDU_LEN` (32) capped both `CcidRule.command[]` and `CcidRule.response[]`. `parse_hex_string`/`parse_hex_pattern` stopped at the cap and returned a **non-zero** count, so `parse_rule_line` still stored the rule as valid (`rule_count++`) — dropping the tail bytes, which for a response include the trailing status word (e.g. `90 00`), with no diagnostic. The shipped `ccid_emulator_sample_cards/piv_emulator.ccid` CHUID response (62 bytes) triggered this and could not be emulated correctly. Fix: split the bound into `CCID_EMU_MAX_CMD_LEN` (64) and `CCID_EMU_MAX_RESP_LEN` (128); both hex parsers now return 0 (error) on overflow instead of a partial count; `parse_rule_line` skips the rule and logs `FURI_LOG_W` instead of storing a truncated one; the rule-line read buffer in `ccid_card_load` was enlarged to fit a full command+response line so long responses are no longer re-truncated before parsing. 128 (rather than a full 256-byte data block) was chosen deliberately: the on-device 4 KB app stack and rule-line buffer make 256 impractical, and 128 covers every response the sample cards and typical EMV/PIV cards produce.

- **ble_scanner / rayhunter_client / uart_sniff**: Removed calls to `variable_item_list_set_header()`, which does not exist in the OFW SDK the CI (`flipperzero-ufbt-action`, official release channel) builds against — the call raised `-Werror=implicit-function-declaration` and those three apps did not compile. The header was cosmetic (a settings-screen title); no behavioral change. Verified against `lib/nfc`/`gui` headers in `flipperdevices/flipperzero-firmware`.
- **flipperpwn**: Added a forward declaration for the `static` `fpwn_wifi_password_done()` callback, which was referenced ~20 lines before its definition — an implicit-declaration `-Werror` build failure. Also fixed a teardown race in `fpwn_wifi_views_free`: marauder was freed before the UART worker was joined, so an in-flight `fpwn_marauder_rx_cb` (holding `marauder->mutex`) could race `furi_mutex_free`. The UART is now freed (joining the worker) before marauder; `fpwn_marauder_free` no longer deregisters the callback itself (documented as caller responsibility). Bumped `fap_version` (1,6)→(1,7) and the About-screen string.
- **rayhunter_client**: Fixed a use-after-free in `rh_app_free` — `rh_worker_stop()` only nulls the RX callback pointer; it does not join the UART worker. Views were freed before `rh_uart_free()` (which joins the worker), so an in-flight `rh_worker_rx_line()` could touch freed views. The UART is now freed before the views.
- **rogue_ap_detector**: Re-run `rogue_detect()` before the RSSI-filter early-return in `rogue_uart_line_cb`, so a threat flag (e.g. EVIL TWIN) doesn't linger in the UI after `rogue_prune_stale()` removed the entries that raised it.
- **spi_flash_dump**: Fixed a start-up race where `worker_state` was set to Reading/Verifying *before* the worker thread started; `worker_poll_timer_cb` could observe `(!running && state==Reading)` during the window and falsely report the operation as finished-with-error. The state is now set after the worker starts.
- **build_all.sh**: Replaced `((PASS++))`/`((FAIL++))` with `PASS=$((PASS+1))`; under `set -e` the post-increment returns non-zero when the value is 0 and aborted the script on the first passing app.

### docs
- **LICENSE**: Added an MIT `LICENSE` file (issue #12). The repository previously had no license file; the README now points to it.
- **README.md**: Updated the License section to reference the new MIT `LICENSE` file instead of the placeholder "See the repository for license details."

### chore
- **Build & lint verified**: bootstrapped the OFW SDK (release channel, f7, API 87.1 — the same SDK the CI `flipperzero-ufbt-action` uses) and confirmed all 13 FAPs build (`ufbt`) and lint (`ufbt lint`) cleanly with the fixes in this changeset.
- **clang-format**: applied `ufbt format` to `ccid_emulator`, `flipperpwn`, `nfc_fuzzer`, and `subghz_spectrum`, which carried pre-existing formatting drift that failed the CI lint job independently of this changeset. No behavioral change; whitespace/wrapping only.
- Reviewed the backlog of open draft maintenance PRs and consolidated the genuinely-unmerged, verified fixes here: the three-app `variable_item_list_set_header` build break (from PR #65), flipperpwn forward-decl + teardown race, rayhunter UAF, rogue_ap stale-threat, spi_flash_dump start-up race, and `build_all.sh` (from PRs #26/#44/#58). Two build claims from an earlier consolidation pass were corrected after verifying the OFW SDK headers directly: `nfc_listener_tx()` takes an `Nfc*` (not an `NfcListener*`), so nfc_fuzzer's pristine call is correct and was left unchanged; and `variable_item_list_set_header()` is genuinely absent from OFW, so the three settings-header calls were removed rather than kept. The remainder are being closed as stale or superseded: PRs based on an outdated `main` that would revert merged work (#11, #13–#21), and the ccid_emulator cluster whose fixes already landed on `main` (PIV CHUID TLV, use-after-free-on-Back) or are superseded by the issue #59 fix above. Cosmetic ccid APDU-monitor display tweaks are deferred to a dedicated ccid_emulator session.

## 2026-05-20

### fix
- **ccid_emulator_sample_cards/piv_emulator.ccid**: Fixed FASC-N TLV length in CHUID response — `30 19` (length=25) should be `30 18` (length=24). With length 25, the parser consumed the GUID tag byte `34` as FASC-N data, leaving invalid tag `10` at the next position. PIV readers would fail to parse the CHUID. Outer `53 3A` (58 bytes) remains correct since total inner TLV sum is 58 with corrected FASC-N length.
- **evil_portal/pcap_capture.py**: Added `from __future__ import annotations` for Python 3.8+ compatibility. The `int | None` union syntax on line 217 requires Python 3.10+ without the future import, causing `TypeError` on older Kali/Debian systems.
- **evil_portal/marauder_serial.py**: Removed unused `import struct`.
- **README.md**: Fixed SPI Flash Dump speed options — said "1 MHz or 4 MHz" but the app has three speeds: Slow (~50 kHz), Medium (~250 kHz), Fast (~1 MHz). No 4 MHz option exists.

### docs
- **spi_flash_dump**: Full re-trace review of all 1926 lines across 3 source files + 2 headers. No bugs found. SPI Mode 0 bit-bang verified, 4-byte addressing correct for >16MB chips, GPIO pins PA4/PB3/PA7/PA6 no conflicts, all Storage API returns checked with file lifecycle correct on all paths, CRC32 computed in worker thread, hex viewer data heap-allocated with bounds-correct draw, 6 views lifecycle correct (ViewModelTypeLocking on both progress views), all snprintf buffers verified, uint64 casts on progress calculations, cross-thread safety verified, stack safe (main ~200/4096, worker ~562/4096, timer ~60/1024).
- **evil_portal**: Re-audited all 16 files (9 HTML portals, 5 .fpwn scripts, 2 Python tools). HTML portals clean (no JS, no external CDN, mobile-friendly). FPWN scripts critically non-functional: all 5 describe Marauder attack sequences (evilportal, BLE spam, PMKID, probe karma) but never send the actual commands — FlipperPwn's engine lacks a `WIFI_CMD` for arbitrary Marauder serial commands. Logged as Tier 7 feature request.

---

## 2026-05-19

### fix
- **hid_exfil**: Fixed Linux cleanup not handling zsh shells — `history -c && history -w` is bash-only and a no-op in zsh. On Linux systems where the user's default shell is zsh, payload commands were saved to `~/.zsh_history`. Replaced with `rm -f ~/.bash_history ~/.zsh_history` + `unset HISTFILE`, matching the Mac cleanup pattern (fixed 2026-04-15).
- **hid_exfil**: Replaced deprecated `Get-WmiObject` with `Get-CimInstance` in Windows sysinfo payload. `Get-WmiObject` was removed in PowerShell Core 6+ (still works in Windows PowerShell 5.1 but deprecated).
- **hid_exfil**: Fixed `-Werror=comment` build failure — glob pattern `*.history` in a block comment contained `/*` which GCC interprets as a nested comment start. Rewrote as `(*.history)`.

### docs
- **hid_exfil**: Full re-trace review of all ~2000 lines across 3 source files. All snprintf buffers verified (line[64] fits all draw paths), 5 views lifecycle correct, worker thread safety correct (volatile on all cross-thread fields, ViewModelTypeLocking on execution view), LED dibit protocol correct (EOT snapshot-rewind, pre-flight CapsLock test), all 21 OS/payload combinations traced, stack usage safe (GUI ~300/4096, worker ~130/4096).

---

## 2026-05-17

### fix
- **flipperpwn_modules/post/add_user**: Quoted `{{USERNAME}}` in all 4 unquoted commands (`net user`, `net localgroup`, `reg add`). Usernames with spaces previously broke command parsing. Replaced deprecated `wmic useraccount` with PowerShell `Set-LocalUser -PasswordNeverExpires` (available since Win10 1607+/PS 5.1).
- **flipperpwn_modules/credential/wifi_harvest**: Changed Linux `sudo` to `sudo -n` (non-interactive) to prevent payload from hanging on password prompt. Now fails silently if user lacks passwordless sudo, still works in CTF/lab environments with NOPASSWD.
- **flipperpwn**: WIFI_JOIN command now supports quoted SSIDs for network names with spaces (e.g., `WIFI_JOIN "My Network" password`). Updated port_scan_report module to use quoted syntax.

### docs
- **rogue_ap_detector**: Full re-trace review of all ~1400 lines across 3 source files. No bugs found. Buffer sizes correct, thread safety correct (volatile on all cross-thread fields, mutex on shared data, NULL context guard), view lifecycle correct (4 views), teardown order correct, stack usage safe (main ~200/4096, UART worker ~700/2048, timer ~60/1024).

---

## 2026-05-15

### fix
- **flipperpwn_modules**: Bumped GUI r DELAY from 300ms to 500ms across all 21 `.fpwn` modules. Run dialog unreliable at 300ms on machines with AV hooks or older hardware.
- **flipperpwn_modules/exploit/uac_bypass_fodhelper**: Changed `-Value "{{COMMAND}}"` to `-Value '{{COMMAND}}'`. Double quotes broke when COMMAND contained typical PowerShell strings with embedded double quotes.
- **flipperpwn_modules/exploit/download_exec**: Added single quotes around `{{PAYLOAD_URL}}` in MAC/LINUX `curl` commands. Unquoted URLs with spaces or shell metacharacters would break.
- **flipperpwn_modules/exploit/evil_twin**: Removed dead `TARGET_SSID` option (declared but never referenced). Quoted `{{PORTAL_URL}}` in LINUX `xdg-open` call.
- **flipperpwn_modules/credential/fake_login**: Fixed Cancel button causing inescapable infinite loop — `ShowDialog()` always returned password text regardless of Cancel/OK. Now checks `DialogResult`, returns `$null` on Cancel, loop breaks on null. Also replaced deprecated `Get-WmiObject` with `Get-CimInstance`.
- **flipperpwn_modules/post/persist_schtask**: Fixed incorrect documentation claiming no admin required. `schtasks /sc onlogon` requires admin. Changed PAYLOAD_PATH default from `C:\Windows\Temp\` to `%TEMP%\`.

### docs
- **badusb_pro**: Full re-trace review of all 2900 lines across 3 source files. No bugs found. badusb_pro.c: 4 views lifecycle correct (Submenu + Widget + custom View + VariableItemList), ViewModelTypeLocking on execution view, worker join-before-reuse, USB save/restore with volatile usb_restored flag, all snprintf buffers verified, settings callbacks index-bounded. ducky_parser.c: ASCII→HID table 95 entries verified for US layout, parse_key_combo words[8]/keycodes[8] bounded, MOUSE_SCROLL strtol+INT8 clamp present. script_engine.c: substitute_vars output-bounded, all flow control depth-tracked, CALL depth guarded at 32, RESTART resets pc+call_depth, do_os_detect CapsLock toggle+timing+restore correct, completion releases all keys+consumer keys. Stack: GUI ~1160/4096, worker ~700/8192. All prior fixes verified present.
- **flipperpwn_modules**: Full re-audit of all 21 `.fpwn` modules and 3 `.ds` sample scripts (last audited 2026-03-30). Re-traced all shell commands for correctness on current OS versions.

---

## 2026-05-08

### fix
- **flipperpwn**: Fixed WiFi text input callback cleared by `text_input_reset` — both the AP scan OK handler (join password entry) and Evil Portal SSID entry called `text_input_reset` which nulls the result callback set during `fpwn_wifi_views_alloc`. After the reset, pressing OK on the text input did nothing. Added `text_input_set_result_callback` after each reset in both code paths.

### docs
- **flipperpwn**: Full re-trace review of all 8237 lines across 9 files (6 .c + 3 .h). All 17 views lifecycle correct (9 in flipperpwn.c + 8 in wifi_views.c), exec thread join-before-start guard, USB save/restore on entry/exit, back-stack navigation complete for all views. wifi_uart.c ISR non-blocking with volatile fields and DMB barriers. marauder.c mutex discipline correct with copy_* accessors. payload_engine.c 40+ command handlers all traced: STRING/STRINGLN bounded, EXFIL/EXFIL_USB CDC lifecycle correct, INJECT depth guard at 4, FOR/WHILE/REPEAT_BLOCK safety caps, IF/ELSE/IF_CONNECTED skip depth consistent. Stack: exec thread ~5.2KB worst case on 8KB.

---

## 2026-05-06

### fix
- **nfc_fuzzer**: Added `furi_assert(app->worker)` after `nfc_fuzzer_worker_alloc()` in `nfc_fuzzer_app_alloc` — `nfc_fuzzer_worker_alloc` uniquely returns NULL on OOM instead of asserting internally (unlike all other 12 apps), so the caller needed an explicit assert. Without it, a NULL worker pointer would cause a confusing crash later in `worker_stop`/`worker_free`.

### docs
- **nfc_fuzzer**: Full re-trace review of all ~3350 lines across 3 source files. All 6 views lifecycle correct (ViewModelTypeLocking on fuzz_run), progress callback mutex-protected with heap-allocated hex buffers for SD card logging, results dynamic array bounded at 64×520B, worker_running set-before-start confirmed, listener/poller/NFC-B/FeliCa run loops all resource-clean on every exit path, TimingTracker rolling window correct, xorshift32 PRNG single-threaded, all 11 profiles × 4 strategies traced with data_len bounds verified (max 65B for Frame boundary). Stack: main ~200/4096, worker ~400/8192. Heap peak ~40KB.

---

## 2026-05-04

### fix
- **subghz_jammer**: Added `furi_assert(worker)` after malloc in `jammer_worker_alloc` and `furi_assert(app->worker)` after `jammer_worker_alloc()` in `jammer_app_alloc` — ensures clean crash message on OOM rather than NULL deref deeper in init. Last unchecked worker allocation in the repo.

### docs
- **subghz_jammer**: Full re-trace review of all ~730 lines. CC1101 device init error paths, scan loop RSSI/window/threshold/consecutive/worst-freq logic, hysteresis behavior, mutex discipline (50ms worker timeout, FuriWaitForever in settings), short-circuit index protection, notification fire outside mutex, volatile on `running`, timer daemon stack safety (~58B), settings callbacks with SDK-clamped indices, 2 views lifecycle, teardown ordering (timer→worker→views→dispatcher→state→records), and back-button exit all confirmed correct.

---

## 2026-05-03

### fix
- **evil_ble**: Removed dead `devices[EVIL_BLE_MAX_DEVICES]` and `device_count` fields from EvilBleApp struct — scanner manages its own internal device array via mutex-protected accessors; the duplicate fields were never referenced, wasting ~2852 bytes of heap.

### docs
- **evil_ble**: Full re-trace review of all ~1150 lines. Buffer sizes (MAC 18B exact, status_buf 256B, device_labels 64B, clone_menu_label 48B, adv payload 31B), view lifecycle (3 views: 2 Submenus + TextBox), UART ISR/worker/DMB pipeline, scanner mutex discipline, extra_beacon clone engine config/start/stop, teardown ordering (beacon→scanner→UART→views→dispatcher→objects), back-button handling, and stack safety (main ~500/4096, UART ~630/2048) all confirmed correct.

---

## 2026-05-02

### docs
- **rayhunter_client**: Full re-trace review — no bugs found. All 1190 lines verified clean across rayhunter_uart.c, rayhunter_worker.c, and rayhunter.c. Buffer sizes (status_row[72], counters[32] exact-fit, footer[48], alert_msg[128], status_buf[64]), view lifecycle (3 views), ViewModelTypeLocking, teardown ordering, UART ISR/worker pipeline, threat keyword parsing, notification de-duplication, settings callbacks, timer daemon stack safety, and back-button handling all confirmed correct. Prior fixes (NULL context guard, volatile connected) verified present.

---

## 2026-05-01

### docs
- **ble_scanner**: Full re-trace review — no bugs found. All ~1300 lines verified clean. Buffer sizes, view lifecycle, mutex usage, volatile annotations, stack safety, teardown ordering, and back-button handling all confirmed correct. Prior fixes (NULL context guard, volatile scanning/connected) verified present.

---

## 2026-04-30

### fix
- **ccid_emulator**: Fix APDU monitor auto-scroll overriding manual scroll during active emulation. The 200ms refresh timer unconditionally snapped `scroll_offset` to the bottom whenever a new APDU arrived, making the Up/Down input handlers non-functional while APDUs were flowing. Added `auto_scroll` flag to `ApduMonitorModel` — disabled on Up press, re-enabled when Down reaches the bottom, reset when emulation starts. The timer now only updates scroll position when `auto_scroll` is true.

---

## 2026-04-29

### fix
- **spi_flash_dump**: Move `settings_return_view` declaration before first use. The file-scope static was declared at line 618 of `spi_flash_dump.c` but referenced at lines 480 and 557 — a C forward-reference error that prevents compilation. Moved the declaration to before `wiring_guide_input_cb` where it is first used.

---

## 2026-04-28

### fix
- **flipperpwn**: Fix `IF_CONNECTED` skip not tracking nested `IF` blocks for depth. The false-branch skip loop in `payload_engine.c` only incremented the depth counter for nested `IF_CONNECTED` but not for regular `IF $VAR == value` blocks. If a module nested `IF...END_IF` inside `IF_CONNECTED`, the skip would stop at the inner `END_IF` and execute commands that should have been skipped when the ESP32 is absent. Added `strncmp(st, "IF ", 3)` to the depth-increment check, matching the pattern already used by the `IF` and `ELSE` skip handlers.

---

## 2026-04-27

### fix
- **subghz_spectrum**: Stop CC1101 worker when navigating back to band select. The radio kept sweeping while the user browsed the band menu, wasting power and holding the radio. Added `view_set_exit_callback` on the spectrum view to stop the worker thread on view exit.

### chore
- **subghz_spectrum**: Remove unused `SPECTRUM_DEFAULT_STEP_KHZ` constant from `spectrum_types.h`. `step_values[]` array is used instead; the define was never referenced.

### fix (uart_sniff — idle-time review)
- **uart_sniff**: Fix ring buffer read returning oldest data instead of newest. `uart_sniff_worker_read` started from `(ring_head - ring_fill)` (oldest byte). Once the 4KB ring had more than 256 bytes, the display showed stale data from the beginning of the capture instead of the most recent bytes. The format function's address calculation (total - got) assumed newest data, producing incorrect hex addresses. Fixed to start from `(ring_head - len)`.
- **uart_sniff**: Add `volatile` to `sniffing` field in `UartSniffApp` for cross-thread visibility. The GUI thread writes the flag and the refresh timer daemon reads it via `uart_sniff_refresh_cb`.

---

## 2026-04-26

### fix
- **hid_exfil**: Fix macOS cleanup leaving session history in `~/.zsh_sessions/`. macOS Terminal.app's session-save mechanism (`/etc/zshrc_Apple_Terminal`) writes per-session history via a `precmd` hook independently of `HISTFILE`. Cleanup now removes `$SHELL_SESSION_FILE` and unsets both `HISTFILE` and `SHELL_SESSION_FILE` so no payload commands persist on disk after exit.
- **hid_exfil**: Add `furi_assert(app->worker)` after `hid_exfil_worker_alloc()` in `hid_exfil_app_alloc` — return value was unchecked, consistent with cross-app malloc assert pattern.

---

## 2026-04-25

### fix
- **badusb_pro**: Clamp MOUSE_SCROLL value to int8_t range in parser. The raw `atoi` result was stored in `int_value` and the executor cast to `int8_t`, silently wrapping values outside [-128, 127] — e.g. `MOUSE_SCROLL 200` scrolled as -56 (wrong direction). Now uses `strtol` with `INT8_MIN`/`INT8_MAX` clamping, matching the existing MOUSE_MOVE pattern.

---

## 2026-04-24

### fix
- **nfc_fuzzer**: Fix worker_running race condition — `app->worker_running = true` was set after `nfc_fuzzer_worker_start()` which already starts the thread. If the worker completed before the assignment, `done_callback` would set it false, then the GUI thread would overwrite to true, leaving the flag stuck. Moved assignment before the start call.
- **nfc_fuzzer**: Fix RATS boundary comment in `nfc_fuzzer_profiles.c` — said 8 PPS cases and 20 total but code correctly computes 6 PPS cases and 18 total.

---

## 2026-04-19

### fix
- **flipperpwn**: Fix use-after-free race in `fpwn_wifi_views_free` teardown. `wifi_status_text` and `wifi_status_mutex` were freed before the marauder log callback was deregistered. If ESP32 sent data during app exit, the UART worker would invoke `fpwn_wifi_rx_callback` which acquires the freed mutex and appends to the freed string. Fix: deregister log callback via `fpwn_marauder_set_log_callback(NULL)` before freeing the string and mutex.
- **ble_scanner**: Add volatile to `connected` field in BleUart struct for cross-thread visibility (UART worker writes on first data received, refresh timer reads via `ble_uart_is_connected()`). Same class of fix as rogue_ap_detector, evil_ble, rayhunter_client, and flipperpwn UART layers.

---

## 2026-04-18

### fix
- **rogue_ap_detector**: Add volatile to `scanning` field in RogueApWorker struct for cross-thread visibility (GUI thread writes via start/stop, timer daemon reads via `rogue_ap_worker_is_scanning()`). Same class of fix applied to ble_scanner, evil_ble, nfc_fuzzer, badusb_pro.
- **rogue_ap_detector**: Add volatile to `connected` field in RogueUart struct for cross-thread visibility (UART worker writes on first data received, API reads via `rogue_uart_is_connected()`). Consistent with evil_ble, rayhunter_client, flipperpwn UART layers.

### refactor
- **rogue_ap_detector**: Remove dead `summary[48]` field and `ROGUE_SCAN_SUMMARY_LEN` constant from RogueScanModel. The field was declared in the view model struct but never written or read — wastes 48 bytes per model instance.

### docs
- **README**: Add Applications section entries for 6 FAPs that were previously undocumented: SubGHz Jammer Detector, UART Sniff, BLE Scanner, Evil BLE, Rogue AP Detector, Rayhunter Client. All 13 FAPs now have feature descriptions in the README.

---

## 2026-04-17

### fix
- **ccid_emulator**: Fix APDU monitor auto-scroll not showing newest entries. `APDU_MON_MAX_VISIBLE` was 6 but only ~3 entries fit on the 128×64 display (each entry = 2 lines at 10px, content area = 52px). Auto-scroll and manual scroll could never reach the most recent APDU exchanges in a full ring buffer. Changed to 3.
- **ccid_emulator**: Fix TLV length fields in embedded test_card sample. MasterFile SELECT response: 6F length 0x19→0x18 (24 bytes actual), A5 length 0x0E→0x0D (13 bytes actual). PSE SELECT response: 6F length 0x1E→0x1C (28 bytes actual), A5 length 0x0C→0x0A (10 bytes actual). Each overstated the BER-TLV content size by 1-2 bytes, causing standards-compliant host parsers to reject or misparse the FCI template.

---

## 2026-04-16

### fix
- **spi_flash_dump**: Move CRC32 computation from FreeRTOS timer daemon to worker thread. `crc32_calc_file` was re-reading the entire dump file from SD card inside `worker_poll_timer_cb`, blocking all system timers for 8-32 seconds on large chips (e.g., W25Q256JV 32 MB) and freezing the UI at ~100% progress. Now computed in the worker thread right after `chip_read` succeeds, with new `spi_worker_get_crc32()`/`spi_worker_has_crc32()` accessors for the timer callback to retrieve results.
- **spi_flash_dump**: Fix Settings Back always returning to WiringGuide regardless of entry point. Settings can be entered from WiringGuide (Right) or ChipInfo (Right), but Back always went to WiringGuide. Now tracks which view opened Settings via a file-scope static variable and returns to the correct view.

### docs
- **spi_flash_dump**: Fix hex_viewer.h header comment — said "Displays 8 bytes per row" but `BYTES_PER_ROW` is 4 (128px display only fits 4 hex bytes + ASCII per line). Updated example to match actual layout.
- **spi_flash_dump**: Correct JEDEC ID database count comment from "30 common SPI NOR flash parts" to "32" in both spi_flash_dump.h and spi_worker.c.

---

## 2026-04-15

### fix
- **hid_exfil**: Fix macOS cleanup leaving payload commands in zsh history. `history -p` is a csh/tcsh command that does nothing in zsh (macOS default since Catalina). After `rm -f ~/.zsh_history`, `exit` caused zsh to rewrite its in-memory history (including all payload commands) to a new `~/.zsh_history`. Replaced with `unset HISTFILE` so zsh skips writing history on exit.

### docs
- **README**: Fix CCID emulator SD card paths — `/ext/apps_data/ccid_emulator/` → `/ext/ccid_emulator/` in 3 locations (description, sample files, FAQ) to match actual code paths
- **README**: Update NFC Fuzzer from "5 Fuzzing Profiles, NFC-A" to "11 Fuzzing Profiles, Multi-Protocol" with 4 fuzz strategies — matches current code

### chore
- Add `check_dist.sh` — verifies `dist/` has a `.fap` for each of the 13 apps and warns when any are stale (source newer than pre-built binary)

---

## 2026-04-14

### fix
- **badusb_pro**: Mark `worker_running` field as `volatile` for correct cross-thread visibility between worker thread (writes `false` on completion) and GUI thread (reads in `app_free` and `start_script_execution`). Same class as nfc_fuzzer, flipperpwn, evil_ble, rayhunter_client, ble_scanner volatile fixes.

---
