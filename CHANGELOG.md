## 2026-04-18

### fix
- **rogue_ap_detector**: Add volatile to `scanning` field in RogueApWorker struct for cross-thread visibility (GUI thread writes via start/stop, timer daemon reads via `rogue_ap_worker_is_scanning()`). Same class of fix applied to ble_scanner, evil_ble, nfc_fuzzer, badusb_pro.
- **rogue_ap_detector**: Add volatile to `connected` field in RogueUart struct for cross-thread visibility (UART worker writes on first data received, API reads via `rogue_uart_is_connected()`). Consistent with evil_ble, rayhunter_client, flipperpwn UART layers.

### refactor
- **rogue_ap_detector**: Remove dead `summary[48]` field and `ROGUE_SCAN_SUMMARY_LEN` constant from RogueScanModel. The field was declared in the view model struct but never written or read — wastes 48 bytes per model instance.

### docs
- **README**: Add Applications section entries for 6 FAPs that were previously undocumented: SubGHz Jammer Detector, UART Sniff, BLE Scanner, Evil BLE, Rogue AP Detector, Rayhunter Client. All 13 FAPs now have feature descriptions in the README.

## 2026-04-17

### fix
- **ccid_emulator**: Fix APDU monitor auto-scroll not showing newest entries. `APDU_MON_MAX_VISIBLE` was 6 but only ~3 entries fit on the 128×64 display (each entry = 2 lines at 10px, content area = 52px). Auto-scroll and manual scroll could never reach the most recent APDU exchanges in a full ring buffer. Changed to 3.
- **ccid_emulator**: Fix TLV length fields in embedded test_card sample. MasterFile SELECT response: 6F length 0x19→0x18 (24 bytes actual), A5 length 0x0E→0x0D (13 bytes actual). PSE SELECT response: 6F length 0x1E→0x1C (28 bytes actual), A5 length 0x0C→0x0A (10 bytes actual). Each overstated the BER-TLV content size by 1-2 bytes, causing standards-compliant host parsers to reject or misparse the FCI template.

## 2026-04-16

### fix
- **spi_flash_dump**: Move CRC32 computation from FreeRTOS timer daemon to worker thread. `crc32_calc_file` was re-reading the entire dump file from SD card inside `worker_poll_timer_cb`, blocking all system timers for 8-32 seconds on large chips (e.g., W25Q256JV 32 MB) and freezing the UI at ~100% progress. Now computed in the worker thread right after `chip_read` succeeds, with new `spi_worker_get_crc32()`/`spi_worker_has_crc32()` accessors for the timer callback to retrieve results.
- **spi_flash_dump**: Fix Settings Back always returning to WiringGuide regardless of entry point. Settings can be entered from WiringGuide (Right) or ChipInfo (Right), but Back always went to WiringGuide. Now tracks which view opened Settings via a file-scope static variable and returns to the correct view.

### docs
- **spi_flash_dump**: Fix hex_viewer.h header comment — said "Displays 8 bytes per row" but `BYTES_PER_ROW` is 4 (128px display only fits 4 hex bytes + ASCII per line). Updated example to match actual layout.
- **spi_flash_dump**: Correct JEDEC ID database count comment from "30 common SPI NOR flash parts" to "32" in both spi_flash_dump.h and spi_worker.c.

## 2026-04-15

### fix
- **hid_exfil**: Fix macOS cleanup leaving payload commands in zsh history. `history -p` is a csh/tcsh command that does nothing in zsh (macOS default since Catalina). After `rm -f ~/.zsh_history`, `exit` caused zsh to rewrite its in-memory history (including all payload commands) to a new `~/.zsh_history`. Replaced with `unset HISTFILE` so zsh skips writing history on exit.

### docs
- **README**: Fix CCID emulator SD card paths — `/ext/apps_data/ccid_emulator/` → `/ext/ccid_emulator/` in 3 locations (description, sample files, FAQ) to match actual code paths
- **README**: Update NFC Fuzzer from "5 Fuzzing Profiles, NFC-A" to "11 Fuzzing Profiles, Multi-Protocol" with 4 fuzz strategies — matches current code

### chore
- Add `check_dist.sh` — verifies `dist/` has a `.fap` for each of the 13 apps and warns when any are stale (source newer than pre-built binary)

---

## 2026-04-14

### fix
- **badusb_pro**: Mark `worker_running` field as `volatile` for correct cross-thread visibility between worker thread (writes `false` on completion) and GUI thread (reads in `app_free` and `start_script_execution`). Same class as nfc_fuzzer, flipperpwn, evil_ble, rayhunter_client, ble_scanner volatile fixes.

---

## 2026-04-13

### fix
- **nfc_fuzzer**: Add `furi_assert` after `malloc` in `nfc_fuzzer_app_alloc` for app struct and results array — prevents NULL dereference on OOM (same pattern as ccid_emulator, ble_scanner, hid_exfil fixes)
- **nfc_fuzzer**: Mark `worker_running` field as `volatile` for correct cross-thread visibility between worker done callback and GUI back-event handler (same class as flipperpwn, evil_ble, rayhunter_client, ble_scanner fixes)
- **nfc_fuzzer**: Fix misleading comment in anomaly notification — LED blink is blue (`sequence_blink_blue_100`), not red
- **subghz_jammer**: Add `furi_assert` after `malloc` in `jammer_app_alloc` for app struct and JammerState — prevents NULL dereference on OOM
- **subghz_spectrum**: Add `furi_assert` after `malloc` in `spectrum_app_alloc` for app struct — prevents NULL dereference on OOM

---

## 2026-04-12

### fix
- **flipperpwn**: Fix marauder `get_*` race condition — migrate all 14 callers in `wifi_views.c` and `payload_engine.c` from unsafe `fpwn_marauder_get_aps/hosts/ports/stations/creds()` to safe `fpwn_marauder_copy_*()` with heap-allocated temporary buffers. Remove dead `get_*` functions from `marauder.h` and `marauder.c`
- **flipperpwn**: Mark `connected` field in `wifi_uart.c` as `volatile` for correct cross-thread visibility between UART worker and GUI threads (same class as rogue_ap_detector, ble_scanner, rayhunter_client, evil_ble fixes)

---

## 2026-04-11

### fix
- **evil_ble**: Add NULL context guard in `evil_ble_scanner_rx_cb` to prevent crash from UART callback teardown race (same class as rogue_ap_detector, ble_scanner, and rayhunter_client fixes)
- **evil_ble**: Mark `scanning` field (scanner struct) as `volatile` for correct cross-thread visibility between GUI and UART worker threads
- **evil_ble**: Mark `connected` field (UART struct) as `volatile` for correct cross-thread visibility between UART worker and API callers

---

## 2026-04-10

### fix
- **rayhunter_client**: Add NULL context guard in `rh_worker_rx_line` to prevent crash from UART callback teardown race (same class as rogue_ap_detector and ble_scanner fixes)
- **rayhunter_client**: Mark `connected` field as `volatile` for correct cross-thread visibility between UART worker and timer daemon threads

---

## 2026-04-09

### fix
- **ble_scanner**: Add NULL context guard in `worker_rx_line` to prevent crash from UART callback teardown race (same class as rogue_ap_detector fix)
- **ble_scanner**: Mark `scanning` field as `volatile` for correct cross-thread visibility between GUI and UART worker threads

---

## 2026-04-08

### fix
- **rogue_ap_detector**: Wire up min RSSI filter — Settings UI stored the value but the worker thread never applied it; APs below threshold are now dropped before detection analysis
- **rogue_ap_detector**: Add NULL context guard in `rogue_uart_line_cb` to prevent crash from race condition during UART callback teardown

### docs
- **rogue_ap_detector**: Update README — min RSSI filter now active, document SSID digit-truncation limitation

---

- **ccid_emulator**: Widen `log_count` from `uint16_t` to `uint32_t` — APDU monitor and log export showed 0 entries after 65,535 APDU exchanges due to integer wrap

---

## 2026-04-05

### fix
- **spi_flash_dump**: Fix progress bar integer overflow for chips >37 MB — cast to `uint64_t` in read and verify progress views (`spi_flash_dump.c`)
- **spi_flash_dump**: Add `furi_assert` after `malloc` in `spi_worker_alloc` and `hex_viewer_alloc`

### docs

---

---

---

## 2026-03-28

---

## 2026-03-26

### fix
- **badusb_pro**: Fix integer overflow in variable arithmetic — `VAR` operations on large values wrapped silently
- **badusb_pro**: Fix silent `$var` dropping — undefined variable references in `STRING` lines were removed instead of producing an error

---

## 2026-03-25

### fix

---
